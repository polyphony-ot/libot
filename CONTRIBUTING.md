Contributing
============

Polyphony is looking for contributors! We pride ourselves on the code being
clean, extensively documented, and well-tested. If you're interested in learning
how a real-time text editor works or want to contribute new features, please
start by filing an issue explaining what you want to work on.

If you're looking for ideas on how to contribute, let us know what topics you're
interested in (OT, porting to a new langauge, editor, etc.) and we can help you
find a way to contribute.

Porting to a new Language/Platform
----------------------------------

Polyphony is also looking for people interested in porting libot to other
languages. If you're interested in this, file an issue on the libot repository
and we can add your port to the Polyphony GitHub org.
